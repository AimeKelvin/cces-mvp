# Jambo — Citizen Complaints and Engagement System

Jambo is a minimal yet powerful MVP built for the Hackathon challenge to address the problem of fragmented citizen complaints handling. This system enables citizens to easily submit feedback or complaints, and allows government agencies to respond, track, and manage these issues effectively.

## 🚀 Features

### 👤 Citizens
- Submit complaints or feedback via a simple, intuitive interface
- Track complaint status using a unique ticket ID or dashboard
- Receive updates when their issue progresses or is resolved

### 🏛️ Government Agencies / Admin
- View, categorize, and respond to citizen complaints
- Access a minimal admin dashboard for managing and routing tickets
- Basic analytics and tracking to monitor trends

### 🧠 Optional (Extensible)
- AI-assisted complaint categorization and routing (future-ready)
- Notification system (email/chat) for responses
- Secure login for dashboard access (optional in MVP)

## 📦 Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** Next.js (TypeScript), Tailwind CSS
- **UI Design:** Lovable AI — Clean, accessible, backend-ready components
- **Backend (to be integrated):** REST API ready
- **Data Handling:** Designed to integrate with real-time and REST APIs

## 💡 MVP Focus

- Usability-first interface for both citizens and institutions
- Clear and simple workflows (from submission to resolution)
- Extensible architecture for future upgrades (AI, analytics, notifications)
