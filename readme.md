Jambo is a minimal yet powerful MVP built for the Hackathon challenge to address the problem of fragmented citizen complaints handling. This system enables citizens to easily submit feedback or complaints, and allows government agencies to respond, track, and manage these issues effectively.

## 🚀 Features

### 👤 Citizens
- Submit complaints or feedback via a simple, intuitive interface
- Track complaint status using a unique ticket ID or dashboard

### 🏛️ Government Agencies / Admin
- View and respond to citizen complaints
- Access a minimal admin dashboard for managing and routing tickets

### 🧠 Optional (Extensible)
- AI-assisted complaint categorization and routing (future-ready)
- Notification system (email/chat) for responses
- Secure login for dashboard access (optional in MVP)

## 📦 Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** Next.js (TypeScript), Tailwind CSS
- **Backend :** Express, Node, JSONWebToken
- **Database:** MongoDB

## 💡 MVP Focus

- Usability-first interface for both citizens and institutions
- Clear and simple workflows (from submission to resolution)
- Extensible architecture for future upgrades (AI, analytics, notifications)

  ## KEY POINT
  Complaint clarrification was done by a simple algorithm that classifies a complaint based on the words it contains in its title and description. This is only for MVP purpose, the app is extensible therefore integrating an AI model will be very easy.
